## What is Deskulpt

Deskulpt is a desktop customization tool that let's you write code to define what's on your computer desktop. It's similar to [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/) for Windows and [Ubersicht](https://tracesof.net/uebersicht/) for MacOS, except it works cross-platformly and allows you to write widgets in React + TypeScript.
